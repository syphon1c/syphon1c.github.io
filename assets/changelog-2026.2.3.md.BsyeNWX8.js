This beta release represents a comprehensive security proxy and monitoring platform for AI infrastructure.</p><p>This release introduces our Guardrails Evaluation scanning tool, improved relationship visualisation graphs on the dashboard, and enhancements to the Canary Token detection feature.</p><hr><h4 id="🕵️-canary-token-detection" tabindex="-1">🕵️ Canary Token Detection <a class="header-anchor" href="#🕵️-canary-token-detection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🕵️ Canary Token Detection&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Canary Token Injection is a security feature that helps detect when data from one user or session is accidentally exposed to another. Think of it as a tripwire : an early warning system that alerts you to potential data leakage in your AI systems.</p><p>When proxying requests, the gateway silently injects unique, invisible tokens into each user&#39;s conversation. If a token surfaces where it shouldn&#39;t, you&#39;ll know immediately.</p><p><strong>Detection types:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cross-User Leakage</strong>: A canary from User A appeared in a response to User B, indicating data bleed between users</li><li><strong>Cross-Session Leakage</strong>: A canary from Session A appeared in the same user&#39;s Session B, indicating session isolation failure</li><li><strong>Provider Memorisation</strong>: A canary resurfaced without being present in the current context, suggesting the LLM provider has memorised prior conversation data</li><li><strong>Stale Canary</strong>: A canary older than 7 days reappeared, a strong indicator of long-term memorisation by the model provider</li></ul><hr><h4 id="🛡️-guardrails-evaluation" tabindex="-1">🛡️ Guardrails Evaluation <a class="header-anchor" href="#🛡️-guardrails-evaluation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🛡️ Guardrails Evaluation&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Having guardrails is one thing.
